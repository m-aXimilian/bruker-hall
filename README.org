* Description
Controlled ramping of a B-field function and measuring
Lockin-Amplifier parameters. Can be used for *Hall-effect* and *MR*
measurements.

** H-Field Ramp
The waveform for the ramp is generated automatically by means of the
parameters (start, stop, increment, etc.) in [[file:config/measurement.yaml][measurement config]] file.
Based on this wave 2 set-values are generated for
1. the xantrex power supply and
2. the PID-controller.
The first is taken from a fit-function (see figure [[fit-fuctions]]) based
on B-field measurements for different power supply voltages.

The PID-controller value is just a scaled value based on the ramp
wave.
See figure [[ramp-set]]  for an example for a triangular shaped ramp from 0 to 1T

** Measurement
The SR8320 sources a sinus voltage, which generates a ``constant''
current by means of a high resistance (kÎ©). The input is locked in at
the source frequency. For every value in of the waveform array
- the respective B-field is set,
- the process waits until the B-field is within the boundary
  ``delta-start'' configured in [[file:config/measurement.yaml][measurement config]]
- a number of N measurements is recorded and written to a file

* Usage
  #+begin_src sh
  git clone --recurse-submodules https://gitlab.lrz.de/m-aximilian/bruker-hall.git
  cd bruker-hall

No issues on rampup. 
On rampdown, the PID current was contantly in the order of 3 to 4A.
